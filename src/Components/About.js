  			<div className="desc">
  				<p>SOCK started as a quarantine project co-located between two pals in NYC and Chicago.</p>
  				<p>Both filled with a love of college/free-form radio and messing about with computers, the two co-founders quickly saw this project
  				grow into a way of connecting with friends they cared about, scattered around the US and abroad.</p>
  				<p>SOCK is a monument to boredom and community, music and social-scenes, love and politics.
  				Give it a go. Or don't, whatever, it's a free countryâ€¦ for now. </p>
